# Configuration

.env.development contains the API-path, so you should check wether that is correct.

By default the app will run in port 3000 and expects the API to be running in: https://localhost:5001

# How to start

This app was created with Create React App and you should be able to run it with just:

npm install
npm run start

It is possible that you need to install react-scripts package separately:
npm install react-scripts --save
